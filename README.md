# Socket Programming: Flow control and loss recovery
A client-server application that compares images that are stored on two end systems.
- The client reads several images from disk, then opens a connection to the server and sends the images to it. Each image is transferred in a single packet. The provided images are small enough to fit in a single ethernet frame.
- When the server receives a packet from the client, it extracts the image data from the packetâ€™s payload and compares it with all of the images that are stored locally on the server. It writes the name of the file that matches the image to a local file. This file can then be used to check that your implementation works as expected
Flow control and packet loss machanisms are implemented, along with a sliding window algorithm. 

## Setup
There is a Makefile with the options:
**make** - compiles both programs resulting in executable binaries "client" and "server"
**make all** - does the same as make without any parameter
**make clean** - deletes the executables and any temporary files (eg. *.o)
